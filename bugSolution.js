The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using the `useEffect` hook.  This hook ensures that the state is accessed only after the component has successfully mounted.
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Access state here after component mount
    console.log('Count after mount:', count);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
This approach ensures that `count` will have a valid value when accessed inside the `useEffect` hook.
